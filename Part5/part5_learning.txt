In this part we learnt about:
	--Operators(arithmetic,assignment,comparison,conditional,nullable)
	--In Arithemtic operators we learnt about (+,-,*,%) which performs basic operations
	-- In assignment opertor(=) we learnt about assigning value to a variable
	-- comparison(==,<=,>= etc) we learnt about checking values with some other values
	-- conditional (&& , ||) we learnt about operators which act as AND and OR gates
	-- at the end we learnt about the ternary (?) operator which allows us to 
	write short syntex for if else condition
