In this part we learnt about:
	--How we can store null to a integral type variable
	-- we learnt about how we can use (?) to allow a variable to store null value
	-- It is alot useful when we are dealing with such options where user does not 
	choose or enter any value so we can store null
	-- It decreases our efforts of making bridge between database and program
	-- We also learnt about the Null Coalescing(??) Operator which converts null value 
	into 0
