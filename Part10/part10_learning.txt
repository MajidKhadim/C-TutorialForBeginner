In this Part we learnt about : 
	-- how to write if else statements and how they work
	-- we learnt about conditional operators(&& and ||) and we also 
	learnt the difference between(&& and &) and (|| and |);
	-- we learnt that when we write (&&) it checks first and if it is false does
	not checks the next ones
	-- But in the case of (|) it checks all the conditions
