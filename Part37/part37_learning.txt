In this part we learnt about:
	-- simple logic where we can use the delegate 
	-- we simply used the hard coded logic and in next demo we will use the delegate to solve this issue
	-- when we hard code the logic in classes It will not be reuseable so we use delegate in this case
	-- we want to allow companies to change the logic to promote their employees
