In this part we learnt about:
	-- What are differences between interfaces and abstract classes
	-- how they are different from each other

	-- Abstract classes can have implementation for some of its members but interfaces cant have the implementation
	-- Interfaces cant have fields where abstract classes can
	-- Interfaces can only be inherited from an interface but abstrac class can be inherited from abtract classes and interfaces both
	-- A class cant be inherited from multiple classes but can be inherited from multiple interfaces at same time
	-- abstract class members can have access modifiers but interface members cant
