In this part we learnt about:
	-- how to create arrays and when to use them
	-- How to assign values and store data in arrays 
	-- we also learnt about the indexes and how to access data from arrays
	-- we learnt about the advantages and disadvantages of arrays
	
	-ADVANTAGES:
		-- They are strongly typed means it can not contain data of other datatypes and only consumes the memory that user wants
	
	-DISADVANTAGES:
		-- If we initiate them with a size then it is fixed it cant grow;
		-- They rely on indexes to store and retrieve data
