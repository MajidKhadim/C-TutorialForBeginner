In this part we learnt about:
	-- what are access modifiers 
	-- where we can access them
	-- There are 5 access modifiers
		1.Public
		2.private
		3.protected
		4.internal
		5.protected internal
	-- we can use only three with type members

	-- when we use public access modifier then this member can be accessed everywhere
	-- when we use private access modifiers then this member can be accesssed only in this type
	-- when i use protected access modifiers then this member can be accessed in this type and the types derived from this type
