In this part we learnt about:
	-- partial methods
	-- rules to create partial methods
	-- partial method contains two parts 
		1.defination(only signature)
		2.implementation
	-- if we dont implement the method it will be ignored
	-- partial method are private by default
	-- we cant provide declaration and implementation at one time
	-- the return type of partial method should be void
	-- partial method can only be declared in partial classes or structs
	-- partial method can be implemented once
