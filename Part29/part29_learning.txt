In this part we learnt about:
	-- what are the diffrences between structs and classes
	
	-- classes are reference type and structs are of value type
	-- value typpe holds the value in memory while reference type holds address of the object in memory
	-- classes objects references are stored in stack and objects are stored in heap
	while the struct is stored in stack
	-- when we create copy of struct object then a new variable is created for copy 
	while when we create copy of a class object no second object is created only reference is created
	-- when we make changes through one object reference then the change is reflected to both object references 
	-- we also learnt about sealed keyword(when we want that no class should be inherited from our class then we use sealed keyword in class declaration)
	-- structs are sealed by default
