In this part we learnt about:
	-- We learnt about MultiCast Delegate
	-- we learnt that multicast delegate is also a type-safe function pointer but it points to more than 1 function
	-- when we use it all the pointed functions will be called
	-- Functions will be called in same order
	-- if the return type is void then its ok but if it has return type int or something else it will last with the return value of last function pointer stored
