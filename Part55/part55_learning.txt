In this part we learnt about:
	-- we learnt about late binding
	-- we use late binding when we dont know which type of object we need at runtime
	-- it can cause runtime errors
	-- early binding is much better for performance and must be prefered over late binding
	-- only use late binding when we have to create instance of types that are not present at runtime
