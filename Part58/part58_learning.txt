In this part we learnt about:
	-- why we should override the equals method
	-- every type has equals method which it overrides from the parent object class so we can override it according to requirements
	-- we mostly use override equal when we are trying to compare objects on the basis of their properties values
	-- when we use the == operator it compares the references while if we dont override the equals method it do the same
	-- so we can override it on our requirement basis
