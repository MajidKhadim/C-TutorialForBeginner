In Part2, we learnt about writing to console screen and getting user inputs from console screen ..
We also learnt about three syntex of writing messeges and variables together.
1. While using concatenation with + symbol like ("Majid Khadim " + var);
2.With using placeHolder syntex like ("Majid Khadim {0}",var);
3.With $ sign which was something new that was not in the video but I learnt it on my own as it is latest syntex of writing syntex
