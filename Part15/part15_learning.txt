In this part we learnt about:
	-- Length property of arrays
	-- Foreach loop where we learnt that we don't need to know the indexes
	or size of the array for iterating over its elements
	-- we dont have to worry about the index out of range exception
	-- we just write its syntex and if the elements keep on increasing it does not
	effect the loop
	-- we also came to know that we dont need any counter variable for and ++/--
	for moving to next index
	-- then we learnt about  continue statement in loops
