In this part we learnt about
	-- Datatype conversions
	--we learnt about the types of datatype conversions
	--Implicit Conversion(those conversions that compiler do on his own)
	--Compiler do the type implicit conversion when there is no chance of info loss\
	and the new variable datatype is bigger than the original var..
		int marksInInt = 78;
		float marks = marksInInt;  
	--Explicit type conversions are done by programmer on their need
	-- we can do this by using syntex like 
		float marks = 56.78;
		int marksInInt = marks(gives error)
		so we do this by 
		float marks = 56.78;
		int marksInInt = (int)marks
	-- But sometime we might have some string values and we are trying to convert themm 
	into float or int so they will give error and program terminates 
	-- TO deal with this issue we use 
	int.Parse() and int.TryParse() methods
