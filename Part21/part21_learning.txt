In this part we learnt about:
	-- Inheritance
	-- when we have same fields or methods in 2 or more classes we can use 
	inheritance such that the same fields and methods come in parent class and
	we can write specific code for child classes
	-- we learnt about pillers of object oriented programming
		-- inheritance
		-- encapsulation
		-- abstraction
		-- ploymorphism
	-- parent class constructor is called before child class constructor
	-- how we can controll which parent constructor is called when we are creating a child class object
