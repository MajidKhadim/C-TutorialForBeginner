In this part we learnt about:
	-- we learnt about how to read content from a file
	-- if we dont use exception handling it will show the exception to user and you will lose users
	-- if also creates a unwanted user experience
	-- if it happens these lines will be skipped and the resource will not be released
	-- if also show the sensitive data to hackers and your application can be hacked
	-- So to address these issues we will use try catch finally block;
	-- all exceptions are inherited from exception class
	-- the specific exception should be written above and then the general ones
	-- finally statements will be executed every time even exception is created or not
