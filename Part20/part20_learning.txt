In this part we learnt about:
	-- static methods
	-- instance methods and fields
	-- what is difference between static and instance methods and fields
	-- if we create a static field it will be same for all instances of this class
	-- static fields can't be accessed in static methods;
	-- for using static field in a non static method you can directly use the
	name of class and then access the field
	-- only static methods and fields can be accessed using class name
	-- while the instance methods can only be accessed using instances
	-- writing access-modifiers on static constructors are not allowed
	-- static constructor are called as the object is created;
	-- we cant assign parameters to static constructor
